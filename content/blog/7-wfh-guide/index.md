# It's not gonna be easy

WFH sounds great in a bubble: no commute time, less distractions, better food options (this one depends on your cooking ability :laughing:). In reality though, an extended WFH period means:

- More meetings
- Worse work-life balance
- More corporate oversight
- Extended 9-5+ schedules

So like Ryan Gosling once said, "It's going to be really hard; we're gonna have to work at this everyday, but I want to do that because I want you. I want all of you, forever, everyday. You and me... everyday.‚Äù Ok maybe not that last bit.

# Shameless Transparency

When working remotely, the default assumption is **nothing**. If they can't see you at your desk, your coworkers and manager are going to assume you went down a YouTube rabbit-hole and ended up in that weird part. This especially speaks true if it takes you an hour to respond on Symphony. _It is now your job_ to shamelessly broadcast what you're doing and what you did. This goes beyond the daily standup where everyone is half-tuned in. Let your team know when you do a deploy, fix a bug (no matter how minor), merge an MR. Doing so will help maintain your "good worker" status and will give your manager some ease of mind üôÇ.

One recommendation is to opt for email communication. I find the lack of distraction as the biggest advantage to WFH. This gets nullified by a bombardment of Symphony pings. Handling communication in timely batches is an easy way to reduce context switching.

# Embrace the Extrovert Inside

We all miss our friends at work, shoutout to my GoGo Curry lunch crew üò≠. Now is not the time to be introverted. We've traded gossip at the water-cooler with daily White House press briefings. It's easy to default to how we normally use Symphony and email for mostly work purposes, but doing so ignores the fact that some of our coworkers are also our friends. It would be like ignoring your mother for a month, and what kind of person ignores their mother :face_with_hand_over_mouth:?

My office has been putting in a lot of effort here. We've been posting pet pics and WFH setups, one coworker started a symphony chat called "NERD SQUAD" where they plan Smash Ultimate hangouts. Remember to have fun and keep things light when you can, it'll help you maintain some sanity.

# Separate Work and Pleasure

My only rule for WFH is DO NOT WORK FROM YOUR BED. Don't even work from your couch. Try to get setup at a table or desk that you can designate as your work only spot. Work only when you're sitting there and when you're sitting there only do work. This is your chance to be your most productive self. Don't cheat yourself by working irregular hours and our habits play a big part in that.

Going hand-in-hand is optimizing your home setup - a good internet connection, a comfy chair. The goal is to reduce distractions - an uncomfortable chair, a slow internet connection, a noisy kid, are all things you should try to get rid of or improve :upside_down: (Ariel wishes she could get rid of or improve me).
